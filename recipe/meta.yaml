  summary: The KEA format provides an implementation of the GDAL specification within the the HDF5 file format.
  description: |
    "KEA is an image file format, named after the New Zealand bird, that provides a full implementation 
    of the GDAL data model and is implemented within a HDF5 file. A software library, libkea, is used 
    to access the file format. The format has comparable performance with existing formats while 
    producing smaller file sizes and is already within active use for a number of projects 
    within Landcare Research, New Zealand, and the wider community."
